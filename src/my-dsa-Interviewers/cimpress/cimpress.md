given an array of distance of towns, and the max capacity of the runner, find how many runner will be required
if the distance of any combined towns is more than the capacity of the runner then a new runner is required

example
input = [10, 20, 30, 15], capacity = 35

10, 20 -> 1
30 -> 2
15 -> 3

so total 3 are required

constraits
input[i] <= capacity
