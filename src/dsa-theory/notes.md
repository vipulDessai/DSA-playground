# subarray vs subsequence vs subset

- subarray
  - consecutive or contineous
  - maintains order and the continuity, could be considered as combinations (nCr)
  - its like subarray is one of the combinations
  - [1, 2, 3, 4] => [1, 2], [2, 3]
- Subsequence
  - maintains order by omitting the inbetween elements
- subsets
  - NO order or continuity
  - kind of like permutations (nPr) where reordering of array could be done, in contrast to combinations where order does not matter
  - its like subset is one of the permutations
  - [1, 2, 3, 4] => [4, 1]
